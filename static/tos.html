    <section>
        <p>Welcome to Wordle Game Bot! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Discord bot services provided by Wordle Game (the "Bot").</p>
        <p class="important">By using the Bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the Discord Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>The Bot is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Bot.</p>

        <h2>2. User Obligations and Conduct</h2>
        <p>As a user of the Bot, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with all <a href = "https://discord.com/terms">Discord Terms of Service</a> and <a href = "https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>
            <li>Only use the Bot for its intended purpose: playing the Wordle game and tracking associated scores.</li>
            <li>Not attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or gain unauthorized access to the Bot's codebase or Supabase database.</li>
            <li>Not use the Bot to spam, abuse, or harass other users.</li>
            <li>Not upload, transmit, or use any content that is illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others (though the Bot only accepts 5-letter word guesses).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Bot:</strong> All intellectual property rights in the Bot itself, including its name, code, functions, and design, are owned by the bot creator.</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> You retain ownership of any data or words you submit to the Bot. By submitting guesses, you grant the Bot the right to temporarily process and store this data to facilitate the game and update public leaderboards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Service "As Is":</b> The Bot is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the Bot's operability, reliability, or availability.</li>
            <li><b>Downtime:</b> We are not responsible for any delay or failure in performance resulting from causes outside our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, Discord API issues or database downtime.</li>
            <li><b>Scoring Accuracy:</b> While we strive for accuracy, the calculated scores and tiers are for entertainment purposes only. We are not liable for any discrepancies or errors in ranking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Bot at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including without limitation if you breach the Terms or violate Discord's policies. Grounds for immediate termination include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheating or exploiting game mechanics.</li>
            <li>Harassing or abusing Bot commands excessively.</li>
            <li>Violation of the Discord Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will endeavor to provide at least 30 days' notice before any new terms take effect. By continuing to access or use the Bot after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

        <h1>Privacy Policy for Wordle Game Bot</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: December 9, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the Discord bot Wordle Game (the "Bot") collects, uses, and stores information gathered from its users while providing its Wordle gaming and leaderboard services.</p>
        <p class="important">By adding or using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Bot is designed to collect only the minimal data necessary to provide its core gaming and ranking features. All data is stored securely in a <a href = "https://supabase.com">Supabase database</a> and is never shared with third parties.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Identifiers (Required for Bot Functionality)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User ID (Discord ID):</strong> Collected for every user who participates in a game or checks a leaderboard.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> To uniquely identify players, attribute scores/wins, and display usernames on the global/server leaderboards.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Guild ID (Server ID):</strong> Collected when a game is started or a score is updated.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> To differentiate server-specific leaderboards and to manage the history of used secret words per server (Simple and Classic modes) to ensure word repetition is minimized.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Content and Game Data (Required for Scoring)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wordle Game Stats (Wins, Total Games):</strong> Updated after every completed game in which a user participated.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> To calculate the Bayesian average score and determine player ranking/tier status.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Guessed Words & Patterns:</strong> Stored temporarily as part of the active game state (e.g., when viewing <code>/wordle_board</code>).
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> To display the current game board and keyboard status. This data is <b>deleted immediately</b> upon game completion (win, loss, or stop).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secret Words:</strong> Stored in the <code>guild_history</code> and <code>guild_history_classic</code> Supabase tables.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> To track words already used on a server to prevent immediate repetition.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>The collected data is used exclusively for the operation of the Bot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display user ranks and scores on the <code>/leaderboard</code> and <code>/leaderboard_global</code> commands.</li>
            <li>To manage and progress the active Wordle game in a channel.</li>
            <li>To ensure fairness and replayability by managing the pool of words used in each server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage Location:</strong> All permanent data (User IDs, Guild IDs, Scores) is stored on a secure, external <a href = "https://supabase.com">Supabase database</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Supabase implements industry-standard security measures, including encryption and strict access controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Game statistics (scores, wins) are stored indefinitely to maintain historical rankings and continuous leaderboards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Removal Requests</h2>
        <p>Users have the right to request the removal of all their personal data from the Bot's database.</p>
        <p>To initiate a data removal request:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send an email to: Ortsx256@proton.me</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon receiving a confirmed request, we will permanently delete all associated User ID, Guild ID, and scoring data within 30 days.</p>

        <h2>5. Compliance and Age Limitation</h2>
        <p>The Bot is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age, which is the minimum age required to use Discord. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately.</p>

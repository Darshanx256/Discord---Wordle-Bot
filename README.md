## 🧩 New Features (Beta)

### 📈 Progression System
- **Wordle Rating (WR)**: Skill-based ladder (Separate Solo vs Multiplayer).
- **Player Level (XP)**: Activity-based progression. Never decreases.
- **Tiers**: Challenger 🛡️ -> Elite ⚔️ -> Master ⚜️ -> Grandmaster 💎.

### 🎮 Game Modes
- **Multiplayer**: Coop/Competitive in a channel (`/wordle`).
- **Solo**: Private, ephemeral game using Discord Buttons & Modals (`/solo`).
- **Classic**: Hard mode with full dictionary (`/wordle_classic`).

### 🎒 Features
- **Shop**: Unlock badges like "Duck Lord" or "Dragon Slayer".
- **Collection**: Find rare easter eggs (Ducks, Dragons) randomly in games.
- **Anti-Grind**: Daily soft-caps to encourage consistency over spam.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment** (`.env`)
    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
    SUPABASE_URL=your_db_url
    SUPABASE_KEY=your_db_key
    ```
    *(Run SQL from `supabase.txt` in your Database first)*

3.  **Start the Bot**
    ```bash
    python wordle_bot.py
    ```

## 🎮 Commands

- `/help` - Visual guide.
- `/wordle` - Start public simple game.
- `/wordle_classic` - Start public hard game.
- `/solo` - **NEW!** Play privately.
- `/guess [word]` - Submit a guess.

- `/profile` - Check your Level, WR, and Collection.

## 🏆 Ranking Rules

- **XP**: Earned from all games. +50 XP for Win, +10 XP per letter.
- **WR (Rating)**: Based on Wins, Speed (<30s bonus), and Efficiency (fewer guesses).
- **Penalties**: None for Multi. High-rank Solo players risk WR slightly.

## ⚡ Performance

- **Optimized DB**: Logic moved to SQL RPC (`record_game_result_v4`) to minimize latency and ensure data integrity.
- **Concurrency**: Async fetching for large leaderboards.
